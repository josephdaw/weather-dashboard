## Description

### User Story

AS A traveler

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
### Mock-Up
The following image shows a proposal of the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Lessons
This project requires a good understanding of server-side APIs. 
I made use of an alternative framework to Bootstrap for this project. The framework I chose was Bulma. It has reasonably good documentation and has been relatively easy to implement. I don't think that it is a feature-filled as Bootstrap, but I found it easier to implement then a couple of others I tried.

This is my most indepth project so far. I have tried to include as much functionality as I could. This lead me to the decision to allow the user to select the units they would like the weather to be displayed in. Throughout this project I have tried to minimise any repeated or unnecessary code as much as possible. This has sometimes streched my abilities and resulted in me breaking something, sometimes to the point I would have to backtrack to the previous Git Commit and start again. While this proved challenging and indeed frustrating, I believe that I have learned a lot from the process.
