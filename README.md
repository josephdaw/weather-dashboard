## Description
A weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS utilising the OpenWeather One Call API.

### User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

The following image shows a proposal of the web application's appearance and functionality:
![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for Atlanta.](assets/img/06-server-side-apis-homework-demo.png)

## Lessons
This project requires a good understanding of server-side APIs. 
I made use of an alternative framework to Bootstrap for this project. The framework I chose was Bulma. It has reasonably good documentation and has been relatively easy to implement. I don't think that it is a feature-filled as Bootstrap, but I found it easier to implement then a couple of others I have tried.
